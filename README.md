# UnderGround_Prototype

Unreal Engine 4 Version 4.14.3

This prototype was made me, and two other team members. 

Character, Idle, Walk, Death, and jump sprite sheets as well as the Male and female zombie sprite sheets were made by Eric Pamphile. 

1 of the level backgrounds was made by Damien Aytche

Other than that the rest was designed, created, developed, and programmed by me Jeremy Trevino. 

There are still some bugs to the prototype, but I figure I'd share some of the prototypes I've been working on.
